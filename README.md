# Regression & Statistical Modeling

This project is based on coursework from **MSIS 642 – Multivariate Analysis and Regression** at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

## 📌 Objective

Build and evaluate regression models to:

- Understand relationships between variables
- Predict outcomes
- Perform statistical inference

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- R and/or Python
- Jupyter Notebook or RStudio
- Statsmodels, scikit-learn, or base R

## ✅ Methods

- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Multicollinearity checks
- Residual diagnostics
- Hypothesis testing
- Model evaluation (R², RMSE, etc.)

## 📂 Planned Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` – EDA and modeling
- `data/` – Cleaned or sample datasets
- `reports/` – Model summaries and interpretation

## 🔍 Key Skills

Regression Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Predictive Analytics, EDA, R/Python
